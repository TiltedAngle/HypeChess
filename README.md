## Usage and General Info

Lichess is an amazing platform that has more than just the ability to play chess, and all for free. We made a custom client for lichess.

## Development workflow

- Run `npm install` to get all packages
- Run `npm run watch` to have webpack start watching your files. All output files will be built in `./dist`
- As an alternative, you can use `npm run build` for a one-shot build
- That's pretty much it :)
